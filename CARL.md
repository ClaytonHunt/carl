# CARL System Architecture & Principles

**CARL (Context-Aware Requirements Language)** - AI-Optimized Planning System for Claude Code

## Overview

CARL is a comprehensive development workflow system designed to bridge the gap between human cognitive simplicity and AI context precision. It provides structured planning, execution, and tracking capabilities through a dual-layer architecture that keeps developers productive while giving AI assistants rich context.

## Core Commands

CARL operates through four primary commands:

1. **`/carl:analyze`** - Establish project foundation and strategic context
2. **`/carl:plan`** - Create work items with intelligent scope detection
3. **`/carl:task`** - Execute work with full context and dependency analysis
4. **`/carl:status`** - Monitor progress and project health

## Key Features

- **Single-File System**: Each work item has one comprehensive file containing requirements, progress, and relationships
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Epics (3-6mo) â†’ Features (2-4wk) â†’ Stories (2-5d) â†’ Technical (varies)
- **Session Continuity**: Daily developer tracking with progressive compaction for historical analysis
- **Dynamic Agent Creation**: Automatically generates specialist agents when domain gaps detected
- **Dependency Management**: Intelligent parallel execution with topological sorting
- **Multi-Developer Support**: Branch-based isolation with git-aware session tracking
- **Schema Validation**: Automatic validation ensures CARL file consistency
- **Hook Integration**: Minimal bash scripts for context injection and automation

## Getting Started

1. Run `/carl:analyze` to understand your project and set up strategic artifacts
2. Use `/carl:plan` to create your first work items with proper scope
3. Execute work with `/carl:task`, which handles dependencies automatically
4. Monitor progress with `/carl:status` for insights and metrics

## Implementation Status

- âœ… **Core Architecture**: Complete documentation and design
- âœ… **Agent System**: `carl-agent-builder` implemented, others planned
- ðŸ“‹ **Hook System**: Architecture defined, implementation templates provided
- ðŸ“‹ **Session Management**: Full specification with compaction strategy
- ðŸ”Œ **MCP Integration**: Framework established for external tool integration

**Next Steps**: Implement the hook system and remaining core agents to bring CARL v2 to life. See [future-recommendations.md](future-recommendations.md) for additional enhancement ideas.
