# CARL System Architecture & Principles

**CARL (Context-Aware Requirements Language)** - AI-Optimized Planning System for Claude Code

## Overview

CARL is a comprehensive development workflow system designed to bridge the gap between human cognitive simplicity and AI context precision. It provides structured planning, execution, and tracking capabilities through a dual-layer architecture that keeps developers productive while giving AI assistants rich context.

## Core Commands

CARL operates through four primary commands:

1. **`/carl:analyze`** - Establish project foundation and strategic context
2. **`/carl:plan`** - Create work items with intelligent scope detection
3. **`/carl:task`** - Execute work with full context and dependency analysis
4. **`/carl:status`** - Monitor progress and project health

## Key Features

- **Single-File System**: Each work item has one comprehensive file containing requirements, progress, and relationships
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Epics (3-6mo) â†’ Features (2-4wk) â†’ Stories (2-5d) â†’ Technical (varies)
- **Session Continuity**: Daily developer tracking with progressive compaction for historical analysis
- **Dynamic Agent Creation**: Automatically generates specialist agents when domain gaps detected
- **Dependency Management**: Intelligent parallel execution with topological sorting
- **Multi-Developer Support**: Branch-based isolation with git-aware session tracking
- **Schema Validation**: Automatic validation ensures CARL file consistency
- **Hook Integration**: Minimal bash scripts for context injection and automation

## Getting Started

1. Run `/carl:analyze` to understand your project and set up strategic artifacts
2. Use `/carl:plan` to create your first work items with proper scope
3. Execute work with `/carl:task`, which handles dependencies automatically
4. Monitor progress with `/carl:status` for insights and metrics

### Ready for Development
- ðŸ“‹ **`/carl:analyze` Command**: Project analysis and setup (requires additional agents)

---

**Current Status**: CARL Core System is **production-ready** with complete planning, execution, and monitoring capabilities. Users can plan with `/carl:plan [requirement]`, execute with `/carl:task [work-item]`, and monitor progress with `/carl:status` - all with full schema compliance and intelligent automation.
