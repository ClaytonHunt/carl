# Audio System (Future Enhancement)

## Current Implementation
**Notification Hook Only**: Cross-platform TTS for "[project-name] needs your attention"
- **macOS**: `say -v "Samantha"`
- **Linux**: `spd-say` or `espeak` fallback
- **Windows**: PowerShell System.Speech

## Future Wishlist
**Custom Character System** (Planned):
- User-configurable "cast of characters" for development interaction
- Default characters based on Jimmy Neutron (Carl, Jimmy, Sheen, Cindy, etc.)
- Support for any character arrangement or theme (custom voices, personalities, catchphrases)
- Character-specific development encouragement and contextual feedback
- Audio categories for different development events (start, progress, success, errors, etc.)
- Personality-driven responses based on development context and progress
- Configurable quiet mode, quiet hours, volume control, and character selection
- Enhanced cross-platform audio system with character voice customization
