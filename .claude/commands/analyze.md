# Analyze Project for CARL

Analyze existing codebases and generate CARL (Context-Aware Requirements Language) files. This command can be used for initial CARL adoption or to update CARL files after team members make changes without using CARL.

## Usage Scenarios

### 1. Initial CARL Adoption
For projects that want to start using CARL:
```bash
/analyze
/analyze --comprehensive    # Deep analysis with full feature mapping
```

### 2. Post-Git Pull Updates  
When team members commit changes without using CARL:
```bash
/analyze --sync            # Update existing CARL files
/analyze --changes-only    # Analyze only recent changes
```

### 3. Specific Directory Analysis
```bash
/analyze src/features      # Analyze specific directory
/analyze --path api/       # Analyze API-related code
```

## Process

### 1. Codebase Discovery
Launch async CARL-optimized specialist subagents for comprehensive analysis:

```
Task: Architecture specialist (carl-architecture-analyst) - analyze system structure for CARL intent mapping, identify major components and their relationships, assess system boundaries for feature extraction
Task: Backend specialist (carl-backend-analyst) - catalog API endpoints for CARL context files, extract data models and business logic patterns, identify service dependencies
Task: Frontend specialist (carl-frontend-analyst) - identify UI components and user workflows for CARL intent files, extract user journeys and interaction patterns
Task: Database specialist (carl-database-analyst) - map database schema to CARL context relationships, identify data flow patterns for dependency analysis
Task: QA specialist (carl-quality-analyst) - assess existing test coverage for CARL state files, identify testing gaps and quality metrics
Task: Security specialist (carl-security-analyst) - evaluate security patterns for CARL compliance tracking, identify security constraints and requirements
Task: Requirements specialist (carl-requirements-analyst) - extract implicit requirements from code patterns, identify missing business rules and constraints
Task: Technical debt analyst (carl-debt-analyst) - identify technical debt items for CARL state tracking, assess refactoring opportunities and maintenance needs
```

### 2. Feature Extraction
**Automatic Feature Detection:**
- Scan directory structure for feature modules
- Identify user-facing capabilities from routes/controllers
- Map database entities to business features
- Extract user workflows from frontend components
- Detect integration points and external dependencies

### 3. Implementation State Assessment
**Current State Analysis:**
- Code completion status by feature
- Test coverage analysis
- Documentation completeness
- Technical debt assessment
- Performance bottlenecks identification

### 4. CARL File Generation

#### Generate Intent Files (.intent)
```yaml
# Example: user-auth.intent
id: feature_user_auth
status: implemented
complexity: medium

intent:
  what: "Users can securely authenticate and manage sessions"
  why: "Access protected resources and maintain user state"
  who: ["end_users", "admin_users"]

constraints:
  must_have: ["password_auth", "session_mgmt", "logout"]
  should_have: ["remember_me", "password_reset"]
  must_not: ["plaintext_passwords", "session_fixation"]

current_implementation:
  files: ["src/auth/AuthController.js", "src/models/User.js"]
  endpoints: ["/login", "/logout", "/verify"]
  tests: ["auth.test.js", "session.test.js"]
  coverage: 85%
```

#### Generate State Files (.state)
```yaml
# Example: user-auth.state  
spec_id: feature_user_auth
last_updated: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
phase: production

implementation:
  completed:
    - component: "AuthController"
      file: "src/auth/AuthController.js"
      tests: "unit,integration"
      coverage: 90%
    - component: "UserModel"
      file: "src/models/User.js"
      tests: "unit"
      coverage: 95%

  technical_debt:
    - issue: "Password reset flow incomplete"
      severity: "medium"
      effort: "1d"
    - issue: "Missing rate limiting"
      severity: "high"
      effort: "4h"

validation:
  tests_passing: true
  security_scan: "passed"
  performance_check: "passed"
```

#### Generate Context Files (.context)
```yaml
# Example: user-auth.context
spec_id: feature_user_auth
codebase_links:
  controllers: ["src/auth/AuthController.js"]
  models: ["src/models/User.js", "src/models/Session.js"]
  views: ["src/components/LoginForm.jsx"]
  tests: ["tests/auth.test.js"]
  
dependencies:
  internal: ["src/utils/crypto.js", "src/middleware/auth.js"]
  external: ["bcrypt", "jsonwebtoken", "express-session"]
  
integration_points:
  database: ["users table", "sessions table"]
  apis: ["/api/auth/*"]
  middleware: ["authentication", "authorization"]
```

### 5. Dependency Resolution
**Smart Dependency Detection:**
- Import/require statement analysis
- Database relationship mapping  
- API endpoint dependencies
- Component hierarchy analysis
- Cross-feature interactions

### 6. Gap Analysis
**Identify Missing Elements:**
- Features with incomplete implementations
- Missing test coverage areas
- Undocumented business logic
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance optimization opportunities
