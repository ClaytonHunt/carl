# CARL Status Dashboard

AI-powered status monitoring that provides real-time insights into project progress, feature completion, and development health by analyzing CARL (Context-Aware Requirements Language) files.

## Intelligent Status Analysis

CARL automatically reads all CARL files and provides comprehensive status insights with predictive analysis and actionable recommendations.

## Usage Scenarios

### 1. Comprehensive Project Status
```bash
/status                          # Complete project health dashboard
/status --summary               # Executive summary view
/status --detailed              # Deep dive with all metrics
```

### 2. Filtered Status Views
```bash
/status --features              # Feature-level progress only
/status --technical-debt        # Technical debt and code quality focus
/status --dependencies          # Dependency health and blockers
/status --team frontend-team    # Team-specific progress view
```

### 3. Time-Based Analysis
```bash
/status --since "last week"     # Changes since last week
/status --sprint current        # Current sprint progress
/status --trend 30d             # 30-day trend analysis
```

## CARL Status Analysis Process

### 1. CARL File System Analysis
```pseudocode
FUNCTION analyze_carl_system_status():
    status_data = {}
    
    // Read all CARL files for comprehensive analysis
    carl_index = read_carl_index()
    intent_files = read_all_intent_files()
    state_files = read_all_state_files()
    context_files = read_all_context_files()
    
    // Analyze feature completion status
    feature_status = analyze_feature_completion(intent_files, state_files)
    
    // Assess technical health
    technical_health = assess_technical_health(state_files, context_files)
    
    // Evaluate dependency status
    dependency_health = analyze_dependencies(context_files)
    
    // Calculate progress metrics
    progress_metrics = calculate_progress_metrics(feature_status, technical_health)
    
    status_data = {
        feature_status: feature_status,
        technical_health: technical_health,
        dependency_health: dependency_health,
        progress_metrics: progress_metrics,
        recommendations: generate_recommendations(status_data)
    }
    
    RETURN status_data
END FUNCTION
```
