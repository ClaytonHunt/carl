# Analyze Project for CARL

Analyze existing codebases and generate CARL (Context-Aware Requirements Language) files. This command can be used for initial CARL adoption or to update CARL files after team members make changes without using CARL.

## Usage Scenarios

### 1. Initial CARL Adoption
For projects that want to start using CARL:
```bash
/analyze
/analyze --comprehensive    # Deep analysis with full feature mapping
```

### 2. Post-Git Pull Updates  
When team members commit changes without using CARL:
```bash
/analyze --sync            # Update existing CARL files
/analyze --changes-only    # Analyze only recent changes
```

### 3. Specific Directory Analysis
```bash
/analyze src/features      # Analyze specific directory
/analyze --path api/       # Analyze API-related code
```

## Process

### 1. Codebase Discovery
Launch async CARL-optimized specialist subagents for comprehensive analysis:

```
Task: Architecture specialist (carl-architecture-analyst) - analyze system structure and generate .context.carl files mapping component relationships, identify major architectural patterns for system.context.carl
Task: Backend specialist (carl-backend-analyst) - catalog API endpoints and data models for backend.context.carl, extract service dependencies and generate api.state.carl tracking
Task: Frontend specialist (carl-frontend-analyst) - identify UI components and user workflows for frontend.context.carl, extract user journeys for ui.state.carl tracking  
Task: Requirements specialist (carl-requirements-analyst) - extract implicit requirements from code patterns, generate feature.intent.carl files for discovered capabilities
Task: QA specialist (carl-quality-analyst) - assess existing test coverage and generate testing.state.carl, identify quality metrics for quality.context.carl
Task: Security specialist (carl-security-analyst) - evaluate security patterns and generate security.context.carl, identify compliance requirements for security.state.carl
Task: Technical debt analyst (carl-debt-analyst) - identify technical debt items and generate debt.state.carl tracking, assess refactoring opportunities for maintenance.context.carl
```

### 2. Feature Extraction
**Automatic Feature Detection:**
- Scan directory structure for feature modules
- Identify user-facing capabilities from routes/controllers
- Map database entities to business features
- Extract user workflows from frontend components
- Detect integration points and external dependencies

### 3. Implementation State Assessment
**Current State Analysis:**
- Code completion status by feature
- Test coverage analysis
- Documentation completeness
- Technical debt assessment
- Performance bottlenecks identification

### 4. CARL File Generation

#### Generate Intent Files (.intent)
```yaml
# Example: user-auth.intent
id: feature_user_auth
status: implemented
complexity: medium

intent:
  what: "Users can securely authenticate and manage sessions"
  why: "Access protected resources and maintain user state"
  who: ["end_users", "admin_users"]

constraints:
