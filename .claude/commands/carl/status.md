# CARL Status Dashboard

AI-powered status monitoring that provides real-time insights into project progress, feature completion, and development health by analyzing CARL (Context-Aware Requirements Language) files.

## Intelligent Status Analysis

CARL automatically reads all CARL files and provides comprehensive status insights with predictive analysis and actionable recommendations.

## Usage Scenarios

### 1. Comprehensive Project Status
```bash
/carl:status                          # Complete project health dashboard
/carl:status --summary               # Executive summary view
/carl:status --detailed              # Deep dive with all metrics
```

### 2. Filtered Status Views
```bash
/carl:status --features              # Feature-level progress only
/carl:status --technical-debt        # Technical debt and code quality focus
/carl:status --dependencies          # Dependency health and blockers
/carl:status --team frontend-team    # Team-specific progress view
```

### 3. Time-Based Analysis
```bash
/carl:status --since "last week"     # Changes since last week
/carl:status --sprint current        # Current sprint progress
/carl:status --trend 30d             # 30-day trend analysis
```

## CARL Status Analysis Process

### 1. CARL File System Analysis
```pseudocode
FUNCTION analyze_carl_system_status():
    status_data = {}
    
    // Read all CARL files for comprehensive analysis
    carl_index = read_carl_index()
    intent_files = read_all_intent_files()
    state_files = read_all_state_files()
    context_files = read_all_context_files()
    
    // Analyze feature completion status
    feature_status = analyze_feature_completion(intent_files, state_files)
    
    // Assess technical health
    technical_health = assess_technical_health(state_files, context_files)
    
    // Evaluate dependency status
    dependency_health = analyze_dependencies(context_files)
    
    // Calculate progress metrics
    progress_metrics = calculate_progress_metrics(feature_status, technical_health)
    
    status_data = {
        feature_status: feature_status,
        technical_health: technical_health,
        dependency_health: dependency_health,
        progress_metrics: progress_metrics,
        recommendations: generate_recommendations(status_data)
    }
    
    RETURN status_data
END FUNCTION
```

## CARL-First Status Analysis

### Primary Data Sources (95% of requests)
1. **CARL Base Files**: `.carl/index.carl`, `.carl/process.carl`, `.carl/vision.carl`
2. **CARL State Files**: `.carl/*.state.carl` - Feature and component states
3. **CARL Context Files**: `.carl/*.context.carl` - System dependencies and relationships
4. **Session Data**: `.carl/sessions/active/*.session.carl` - Current development tracking
5. **Strategic Files**: `.carl/roadmap.carl`, `.carl/objectives.carl` - Planning context
6. **Git Metadata**: Recent commit history and branch status (lightweight)

### Secondary Data Sources (Only when CARL data insufficient)
4. **Selective Code Scanning**: Only specific files identified by CARL analysis
5. **External APIs**: Only when explicitly requested or CARL indicates integration issues

### Performance Optimization
- **Fast Path**: Read CARL files first, determine if sufficient for request
- **Selective Scanning**: Only scan additional files when specific gaps identified
- **Session Priority**: Trust hook-maintained session data as authoritative source
- **Cached Analysis**: Leverage previously analyzed data from CARL state files

## Integration Points

- **Primary Input**: CARL files (index.carl, session files, hook data)
- **Secondary Input**: Selective code scanning only when CARL data has gaps
- **Output**: Comprehensive status dashboard prioritizing CARL-maintained insights
- **Next Commands**:
  - `/carl:plan [recommendation]` to plan recommended improvements
  - `/carl:task [critical-issue]` to address immediate issues
  - `/carl:analyze --sync` to refresh CARL data before status analysis

## Efficient Status Workflow

### Step 1: Read CARL Files (Always First)
```bash
# Priority order for file reading:
1. .carl/index.carl - Project overview and current state
2. .carl/process.carl - Development workflow and current phase
3. .carl/sessions/active/*.session.carl - Current session tracking
4. .carl/*.state.carl - Feature and component state files
5. .carl/*.context.carl - System context and dependencies
6. .carl/config/carl-settings.json - Project configuration
```

### Step 2: Assess Data Completeness
- **If CARL files provide sufficient context**: Generate status report immediately
- **If specific gaps identified**: Only then read additional targeted files
- **Never scan entire codebase**: Trust CARL-maintained state as authoritative

### Step 3: Generate Insights
- **Primary**: Use CARL file data for 95% of status information
- **Supplementary**: Add targeted file analysis only for identified gaps
- **Efficient**: Leverage hook-maintained session progress as current state

### Implementation Guidelines
- **Read CARL files first**: Always start with comprehensive CARL file analysis
- **Trust the hooks**: Session data from hooks is authoritative for current state
- **Selective expansion**: Only read additional files when CARL data has specific gaps
- **Performance target**: 95% of status requests served from CARL files alone

CARL's optimized status system provides comprehensive project health insights by prioritizing CARL-maintained data, ensuring fast response times while maintaining accuracy and completeness.
