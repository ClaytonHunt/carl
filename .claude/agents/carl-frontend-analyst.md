## CARL-Specific Analysis Patterns

### User Journey Extraction
```pseudocode
FUNCTION extract_user_journeys():
    journeys = {}
    routes = discover_all_routes()
    
    FOR EACH route IN routes DO
        // Analyze route components and interactions
        components = get_route_components(route)
        interactions = analyze_component_interactions(components)
        
        journey = {
            entry_point: route.path,
            user_goal: infer_user_goal(route, components),
            steps: extract_interaction_steps(interactions),
            success_criteria: define_success_metrics(journey),
            failure_scenarios: identify_error_paths(interactions),
            accessibility_requirements: assess_accessibility_needs(components)

    components_with_state = find_stateful_components()
    FOR EACH component IN components_with_state DO
        local_state = {
            state_variables: extract_local_state(component),
            state_updates: analyze_state_updates(component),
            side_effects: identify_side_effects(component)
