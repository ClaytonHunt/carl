## Core System Decisions

### DEC-001: System Name and Mascot
**Decision**: Name the system CARL (Context-Aware Requirements Language) with Carl Wheezer from Jimmy Neutron as the mascot

**Rationale**:
- Creates memorable acronym that emphasizes AI's need for context
- Carl Wheezer mascot is perfect - he asks clarifying questions like good requirements gathering
- Fun and engaging for developers while maintaining professional functionality
- Enables audio feedback system with character voice

**Alternatives Considered**:
- ARL (AI Requirements Language) - rejected for lack of character
- Various other acronyms - none captured the personality we wanted

**Impact**: Positive team adoption, memorable branding, enables unique audio feedback system

---

### DEC-002: Dual-Layer Architecture Design
**Decision**: Implement dual-layer architecture with simple human commands generating rich AI artifacts

**Rationale**:
- Developers prefer simple, memorable commands
- AI needs structured, machine-readable data for perfect context
- Separation allows optimization for both human UX and AI consumption
- Enables progressive complexity - simple commands can generate comprehensive planning

**Architecture**:
```
Human Layer: Simple commands (/plan, /task, /status, /analyze, /settings)
AI Layer: Structured CARL files (.intent, .state, .context, index.carl)
```

**Impact**: 
- Best of both worlds - simple human interface, rich AI context
- Enables AI to have perfect project understanding
- Reduces cognitive load on developers

---

### DEC-003: CARL File Structure Design
**Decision**: Three-file system with specific purposes

**File Types**:
1. **Intent Files (.intent)** - What needs to be built (requirements, constraints, success criteria)
2. **State Files (.state)** - What's been built (implementation progress, quality metrics)
3. **Context Files (.context)** - How code relates (dependencies, integration points)

**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns for AI consumption
- Enables precise AI understanding of requirements vs implementation vs relationships
- Supports both planning and implementation phases
- Allows independent updates without conflicts

**Additional Files**:
- `index.carl` - Master AI reference for quick context loading
- Session files - Work continuity tracking
- Templates - Consistent file generation

**Impact**: AI has structured, predictable access to all project context

---

### DEC-004: Claude Code Hook Integration Strategy
**Decision**: Use Claude Code hooks for automatic CARL context injection and progress tracking

**Hook Implementation**:
- **Session Start**: Load CARL context, play welcome audio
- **User Prompt Submit**: Inject relevant CARL context into every AI request
- **Tool Call**: Track progress, play audio feedback, update CARL files
- **Session End**: Save state, generate summaries, play farewell audio

**Rationale**:
- Automatic operation - no manual intervention required
- Perfect AI context on every interaction
- Real-time progress tracking and documentation
- Seamless integration with existing Claude Code workflows

**Impact**: AI always has perfect project context, automatic progress tracking, delightful user experience

---

### DEC-005: Command Simplification Strategy
**Decision**: Reduce from 6+ complex planning commands to 5 adaptive core commands

**Core Commands**:
1. `/carl:analyze` - Scan and generate CARL files from existing code
2. `/carl:plan` - Intelligent, context-aware planning (auto-detects epic/feature/story scope)
3. `/carl:status` - AI-powered progress monitoring and recommendations
4. `/carl:task` - Context-aware task execution with CARL integration
5. `/carl:settings` - Configure CARL behavior and preferences

**Rationale**:
- Reduced cognitive load - fewer commands to remember
- Intelligent scope detection - AI determines appropriate planning depth
- Context-aware behavior - commands adapt to project state
- Self-contained - each command is comprehensive for its purpose

**Eliminated Complexity**:
- No separate epic/feature/story commands - `/carl:plan` handles all
- No separate breakdown commands - integrated into planning
- No separate sync commands - handled automatically

**Impact**: 50% reduction in command complexity while maintaining full functionality

---

### DEC-006: CARL-Optimized Specialist Agents
**Decision**: Create specialized agents optimized for CARL analysis and generation

**Specialist Types**:
- **carl-architecture-analyst** - System structure for CARL intent mapping

- **carl-debt-analyst** - Technical debt tracking for CARL state files
- **carl-quality-analyst** - Testing and quality for CARL specifications
- **carl-security-analyst** - Security patterns for CARL compliance

**Rationale**:
- Domain expertise ensures accurate CARL file generation
- Specialized analysis provides comprehensive project understanding

- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Configurable quiet mode and quiet hours
- Context-appropriate audio for different development events

**Audio Categories**:
- **Start**: Session beginning, welcoming
- **Work**: Task initiation, encouragement  
- **Progress**: Milestone achievements, updates
- **Success**: Test passing, build success
- **End**: Session completion, farewell

**Rationale**:
- Enhances developer experience and engagement
- Provides immediate feedback on progress
- Character consistency with Carl Wheezer mascot
- Configurable for different preferences and environments

**Impact**: Unique, engaging developer experience while maintaining professional functionality

---

### DEC-008: Analyze Command with Team Sync
**Decision**: `/analyze` command handles both initial adoption and team synchronization

**Dual Purpose**:
1. **Initial CARL Adoption**: Scan existing codebases and generate complete CARL structure
2. **Team Synchronization**: Update CARL files after non-CARL team members make changes (git pull scenarios)

**Rationale**:
- Single command handles both use cases intelligently
- Enables CARL adoption in existing projects
- Solves team adoption challenges where not everyone uses CARL
- Automatic detection of analysis type needed

**Implementation**:
- Detects existing CARL files vs new project
- Git-aware - analyzes changes since last update
- Progressive analysis - updates only what's needed for sync

**Impact**: Seamless CARL adoption and team collaboration regardless of CARL usage consistency

---

### DEC-009: Context Injection Strategy
**Decision**: Automatic CARL context injection into every relevant AI prompt

**Implementation**:
- User prompt submit hook analyzes prompt content
- Automatically injects relevant CARL context for commands and implementation tasks
- Targeted context loading based on prompt keywords
- Configurable - can be disabled if needed

**Context Types**:
- **Active Context**: Current session, recent files, index overview
- **Targeted Context**: Specific CARL files matching prompt keywords
- **Full Context**: Comprehensive project context for complex tasks

**Rationale**:
- AI always has perfect project understanding
- No manual context management required
- Intelligent context selection prevents overload
- Enables accurate, context-aware responses

**Impact**: AI assistance is always perfectly informed about project state and requirements
