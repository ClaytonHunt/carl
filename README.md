## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

Install CARL with a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/ClaytonHunt/carl/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

**Alternative installation options:**
```bash
# Install specific version
curl -fsSL https://github.com/ClaytonHunt/carl/releases/download/v2.0.0/install.sh | bash

# Dry run (see what would be installed)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/ClaytonHunt/carl/releases/latest/download/install.sh | CARL_DRY_RUN=1 bash

# Verbose installation
curl -fsSL https://github.com/ClaytonHunt/carl/releases/latest/download/install.sh | CARL_VERBOSE=1 bash
```

### 2. Initialize Your Project

```bash
# Let CARL analyze and set up your project
/carl:analyze
```

### 3. Start Planning

Create your first work item:
```bash
/carl:plan "Add user authentication system"
```

### 4. Execute Work

Start implementing:
```bash
/carl:task user-authentication.feature.carl
```

### 5. Monitor Progress

Check your progress:
```bash
/carl:status
```

## Why CARL?

### For Developers
- **Zero Cognitive Load**: Four simple commands handle all complexity
- **Automatic Dependency Management**: Work executes in the right order  
- **Session Continuity**: Never lose context between coding sessions
- **Quality Gates**: Built-in TDD and testing integration

### For AI Assistants
- **Rich Context**: Every work item has comprehensive requirements and progress
- **Schema Validation**: Automatic data integrity with self-healing
- **Specialized Agents**: Domain-specific assistants created as needed
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed activity logs for trend analysis

## Core Commands

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `/carl:analyze` | Set up project foundation | `/carl:analyze` |
| `/carl:plan` | Create work items | `/carl:plan "Add user dashboard"` |
| `/carl:task` | Execute work | `/carl:task dashboard.feature.carl` |
| `/carl:status` | Monitor progress | `/carl:status --week` |

## Features

### üéØ **Intelligent Scope Detection**
CARL automatically classifies work as Epic (3-6mo), Feature (2-4wk), Story (2-5d), or Technical based on complexity and requirements.

### üîÑ **Dependency Management** 
Advanced topological sorting enables parallel execution of independent work while respecting dependencies.

### üìä **Session Analytics**
Daily session tracking with velocity analysis, health monitoring, and actionable insights.

### ü§ñ **Dynamic Agent Creation**
Automatically generates specialist agents for unfamiliar technologies or domains.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Schema Validation**
All CARL files validated against schemas with automatic error fixing.

### üë• **Multi-Developer Support**
Branch-aware session isolation with git integration for team coordination.

## Architecture

CARL uses a **dual-layer architecture**:

- **Human Layer**: Simple commands (`/carl:analyze`, `/carl:plan`, `/carl:task`, `/carl:status`)  
- **AI Layer**: Rich CARL files with comprehensive context and relationships
