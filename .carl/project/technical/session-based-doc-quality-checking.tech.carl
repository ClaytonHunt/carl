# Technical Specifications
technical_requirements:
  - "Replace file-based timestamp checking with session-based tracking"
  - "Integrate with CARL session management system (session-YYYY-MM-DD-{git-user}.carl files)"
  - "Implement 2-hour check interval instead of current 5-minute cooldown"
  - "Hook execution on session start and stop events"
  - "Session file parsing for timestamp retrieval and recording"
  - "Error handling for missing or corrupted session files"
  - "Maintain existing project-documentation-quality-auditor agent capabilities"
  - "Focus agent analysis on accuracy and design validation"

implementation_approach:
  - "Modify .carl/hooks/doc-quality-check.sh to integrate with session hooks"
  - "Add session file parsing functions for timestamp management"
  - "Update hook invocation points (session start/stop)"
  - "Enhance project-documentation-quality-auditor agent focus"
  - "Implement graceful error handling and fallback mechanisms"

architecture_changes:
  - "Replace standalone timestamp file with session-integrated tracking"
  - "Hook integration with session lifecycle events"
  - "Session file schema extension for documentation check metadata"

# Acceptance Criteria
acceptance_criteria:
  - "Hook script successfully integrates with session start and stop events"
  - "Timestamp tracking uses session files instead of separate files"
  - "2-hour check interval is properly implemented and enforced"
  - "Documentation quality auditor agent is triggered based on session-tracked timestamps"
  - "Agent focuses on accuracy and design validation aspects"
  - "System handles missing or corrupted session files gracefully"
  - "No performance impact on session start/stop operations"
  - "Existing agent capabilities are maintained while improving focus areas"

# Quality Gates
quality_requirements:
  - "All existing functionality preserved during refactoring"
  - "Session file format remains compatible with existing session management"
  - "Error handling covers all identified edge cases"
  - "Performance metrics show no degradation in session operations"
  - "Agent output provides actionable accuracy and design recommendations"

# Documentation Updates Needed
documentation_updates: []

# Notes
notes:
  - "Current doc-quality-check.sh uses file-based timestamp checking with 5-minute cooldown"
  - "project-documentation-quality-auditor agent exists with comprehensive scoring system"
  - "Session files follow format: session-YYYY-MM-DD-{git-user}.carl"
  - "Focus should be on seamless integration with existing CARL session infrastructure"
