type: "story"
parent_id: "features/interactive-planning-system-enhancement"
complexity: "medium"
priority: "P0"
estimated_duration: "1 day"
created_date: "2025-07-30T17:17:00-04:00"
status: "planning"

intent_definition:
  what: "Implement validation to prevent requirements analyst execution until all planning questions are answered"
  why: "Core issue - current system executes analyst with incomplete context causing poor requirements analysis"
  who: ["carl_requirements_analyst", "planning_system_users", "all_carl_workflows"]
  when: "Critical - this is the main problem the feature addresses"
  constraints:
    - "must_prevent_analyst_execution_until_all_5_questions_answered"
    - "must_compile_complete_context_before_analyst_invocation"
    - "must_maintain_existing_analyst_integration_interface"
    - "must_provide_clear_feedback_about_incomplete_requirements"

user_story:
  as: "requirements analyst system"
  i_want: "to receive complete context with all user responses"
  so_that: "I can provide high-quality analysis instead of analysis in vacuum"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "analyst execution blocked until complete context available"
  - "complete context includes initial input plus all 5 user responses"
  - "analyst receives compiled context in expected format"
  - "clear validation prevents incomplete context scenarios"
  - "existing analyst interface remains unchanged"
  - "error messages guide users to complete requirements gathering"

technical_requirements:
  implementation_approach:
    - "add_validation_check_before_analyst_invocation"
    - "implement_complete_context_compilation_function"
    - "modify_analyst_task_call_to_use_compiled_context"
    - "add_clear_error_handling_for_incomplete_requirements"
  
  validation_logic:
    - "verify_all_5_questions_have_responses"
    - "compile_initial_input_plus_all_user_answers"
    - "format_context_for_analyst_consumption"
    - "validate_context_completeness_before_execution"
  
  integration_points:
    - "carl_requirements_analyst_task_invocation"
    - "complete_context_compilation_function"
    - "session_state_management_system"
    - "error_handling_and_user_feedback"

business_impact:
  problem_solved: "Eliminates analysis in vacuum - the core issue destroying requirements quality"
  expected_outcome: "Dramatically improved intent file quality from complete requirements context"
  success_metrics:
    - "zero_analyst_executions_with_incomplete_context"
    - "measurable_improvement_in_intent_file_completeness"
    - "elimination_of_poor_quality_requirements_analysis"

definition_of_done:
  - "analyst execution prevented until all questions answered"
  - "complete context compilation working correctly"
  - "analyst receives full context in proper format"  
  - "validation and error handling implemented"
  - "tested with various requirement scenarios"
  - "ready for quality validation phase"
