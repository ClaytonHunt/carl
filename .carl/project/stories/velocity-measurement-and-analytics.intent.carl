story_definition:
  name: "Velocity Measurement and Analytics"
  description: "Calculate team delivery velocity and planning accuracy from historical CARL work timing data"
  
  user_story: |
    As a development team using CARL for project management,
    I want to measure our actual delivery velocity compared to planning estimates,
    So that I can improve sprint planning accuracy and predict realistic delivery timelines.
  
  problem_statement: |
    Teams cannot measure actual delivery performance or improve planning accuracy without 
    analytics that compare estimated vs. actual work timing. Need comprehensive velocity
    measurement to enable data-driven sprint planning and capacity forecasting.

acceptance_criteria:
  primary_scenarios:
    - scenario: "Historical velocity calculation"
      given: "Multiple completed CARL items with actual timing data"
      when: "Velocity analysis is requested"
      then: "Team velocity metrics are calculated showing work completion rate over time"
      
    - scenario: "Planning accuracy assessment"
      given: "CARL items with both planning estimates and actual completion timing"
      when: "Estimate accuracy analysis is performed"
      then: "Planning accuracy percentages and variance trends are displayed"
      
    - scenario: "Sprint velocity forecasting"
      given: "Historical velocity data and current sprint backlog"
      when: "Sprint completion forecast is requested"
      then: "Realistic completion timeline is predicted based on actual team velocity"
      
    - scenario: "Velocity trend analysis"
      given: "Multiple sprints/iterations of velocity data"
