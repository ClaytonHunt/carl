intent_definition:
  what: "Complete testing and validation of session state persistence between sequential planning questions"
  why: "Need to ensure the 75% complete pseudocode structure works reliably before moving to analyst integration"
  who: ["carl_developers", "planning_system_users"]
  when: "Immediate - blocking analyst integration phase"
  constraints:
    - "must_validate_session_state_survives_between_questions"
    - "must_test_question_flow_continuation_works_correctly"
    - "must_verify_complete_context_compilation_functions"
    - "must_not_break_existing_planning_functionality"

user_story:
  as: "CARL planning system"
  i_want: "session state to persist correctly between sequential questions"
  so_that: "users can complete the full planning workflow without losing progress"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "session state file is created and maintained throughout question sequence"
  - "user responses are correctly saved and retrievable between questions"
  - "question progression works correctly (1→2→3→4→5→analysis)"
  - "complete context compilation includes all user responses"
  - "session cleanup happens after successful completion"
  - "error handling works for interrupted sessions"

technical_requirements:
  validation_points:
    - "test_session_file_creation_and_persistence"
    - "test_response_storage_and_retrieval"
    - "test_question_sequence_flow"
    - "test_context_compilation_completeness"
    - "test_session_cleanup_after_completion"
  
  test_scenarios:
    - "complete_happy_path_all_questions_answered"
    - "interrupted_session_recovery"
    - "invalid_response_handling"
    - "session_timeout_cleanup"
  
  success_validation:
    - "all_pseudocode_functions_work_as_designed"
    - "session_state_management_is_reliable"
    - "ready_for_analyst_integration_phase"

definition_of_done:
  - "session state persistence tested and validated"
  - "question flow works end-to-end"
  - "context compilation produces complete user responses"
  - "error handling covers edge cases"
  - "ready to proceed to analyst integration phase"
