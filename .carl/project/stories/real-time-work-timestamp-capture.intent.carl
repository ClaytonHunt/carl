  name: "Real-Time Work Timestamp Capture"
  description: "Automatically capture actual work start and completion timestamps during active development sessions"
  
  user_story: |
    As a development team using CARL for project tracking,
    I want work start and completion times automatically captured during my development sessions,
    So that I can measure actual delivery velocity without manual time tracking overhead.
  
  problem_statement: |
    Currently, CARL files contain estimated or fictional timestamps that don't reflect actual 
    work timing. Teams need automatic capture of real work sessions to enable velocity measurement
    without adding manual time tracking burden to developers.

acceptance_criteria:
  primary_scenarios:
    - scenario: "Work session start timestamp capture"
      given: "Developer executes /carl:task on a CARL intent"
      when: "Active work begins on a story/feature/epic"
      then: "actual_work_started timestamp is captured and stored in corresponding state file"
      
    - scenario: "Work progress timestamp updates"
      given: "Developer is actively working in a session with CARL context"
      when: "Meaningful progress occurs (tool calls, file changes, commits)"
      then: "last_activity_timestamp is updated to reflect ongoing work"
      
    - scenario: "Work completion timestamp capture"
      given: "Developer completes work on a CARL intent"
      when: "Work is marked as completed or session ends"
      then: "actual_work_completed timestamp is captured and work duration calculated"
      
    - scenario: "Multi-session work tracking"
      given: "Work on a CARL intent spans multiple development sessions"
      when: "Developer returns to work on the same intent in a new session"  
      then: "Additional session timestamps are tracked and total work duration accumulated"
