  name: "CARL Infrastructure Modernization"
  description: "Migrate CARL's bash-based scripts to well-architected, testable Node.js while maintaining exact functionality"
  
  problem_statement: |
    Current CARL infrastructure relies on bash scripts that are difficult to maintain, test, and extend.
    The bash-based Claude Code hook scripts and helper functions lack proper error handling, testing 
    capabilities, and sophisticated data processing needed for advanced features like velocity measurement 
    and stagnation detection. Need to migrate to Node.js for better maintainability while preserving 
    all existing functionality.
  
  solution_vision: |
    Migrate CARL to modern Node.js infrastructure with:
    - Direct migration of bash hook scripts to Node.js (maintaining exact functionality)
    - Well-architected, modular codebase with clear separation of concerns
    - Comprehensive unit testing and integration testing
    - Sophisticated data processing capabilities for analytics and measurement
    - Robust error handling and logging system
    - Foundation for future advanced features like AI context optimization and velocity analytics
