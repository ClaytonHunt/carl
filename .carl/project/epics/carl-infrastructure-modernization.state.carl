phase_1_completion_summary: |
  Phase 1 of CARL Infrastructure Modernization achieved major success with Node.js Hook System:
  
  ✅ All bash hooks migrated to Node.js with 100% functionality preservation
  ✅ 93 comprehensive unit tests establishing testing foundation
  ✅ Cross-platform compatibility for Windows, macOS, Linux
  ✅ Improved maintainability and error handling
  ✅ Foundation established for advanced data processing features
  
  Epic now 17% complete with solid foundation for remaining features.
  Next phase should focus on file processing engine and session management.
