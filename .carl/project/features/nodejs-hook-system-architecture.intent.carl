feature_definition:
  name: "Node.js Hook System Architecture"
  description: "Replace bash-based Claude Code hooks with well-architected Node.js modules for improved maintainability and advanced capabilities"
  
  problem_statement: |
    Current bash hooks are difficult to maintain, test, and debug. They lack sophisticated error 
    handling, data processing capabilities, and unit testing support. This limits CARL's ability 
    to implement advanced features like accurate timestamp capture, session correlation, and 
    velocity measurement. Need modern, testable infrastructure foundation.
  
  solution_approach: |
    Implement modular Node.js-based hook system with proper architecture, comprehensive error 
    handling, and unit testing. Create reusable modules for common operations, establish clear 
    interfaces between components, and enable advanced data processing for analytics features.
