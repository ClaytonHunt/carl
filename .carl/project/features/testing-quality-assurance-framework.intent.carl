  name: "Testing and Quality Assurance Framework"
  description: "Comprehensive testing infrastructure with unit tests, integration tests, and automated quality gates"
  
  problem_statement: |
    Current bash scripts have no automated testing, making refactoring risky and bugs difficult 
    to prevent. Cannot ensure code quality, catch regressions, or safely implement new features. 
    Need professional testing framework enabling confident development and maintenance of CARL 
    infrastructure.
  
  solution_approach: |
    Establish Jest-based testing framework with comprehensive test suites, automated CI/CD 
    integration, code coverage requirements, and quality gates. Enable test-driven development 
    (TDD) practices and continuous quality assurance throughout CARL modernization.
