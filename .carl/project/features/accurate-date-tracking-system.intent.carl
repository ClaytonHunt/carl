feature_definition:
  name: "Accurate Date Tracking System"
  description: "Dual-layer date system enabling real velocity measurement through accurate work timestamps while preserving planning estimation capabilities"
  
  problem_statement: |
    Current CARL files use estimated/fictional dates rather than actual work timestamps, 
    preventing accurate velocity measurement and backlog stagnation detection. Teams cannot 
    assess actual delivery performance vs. planning estimates.
  
  solution_approach: |
    Implement dual-layer date system with separate fields for planning estimates and actual 
    work timestamps. Integrate with session management and hook system for automatic capture 
    of real work start/completion times. Enable velocity analytics and backlog age analysis.
