feature_definition:
  name: "CARL File Processing Engine"
  description: "Advanced Node.js-based YAML processing engine with validation, transformation, and analytics capabilities for CARL files"
  
  problem_statement: |
    Current bash-based CARL file processing lacks sophisticated validation, error reporting, and 
    data transformation capabilities. Simple sed/awk operations limit ability to implement complex 
    features like dual-layer date systems, cross-file analytics, and dependency tracking. Need 
    robust processing engine to enable advanced CARL features.
  
  solution_approach: |
    Build comprehensive Node.js file processing engine with YAML parsing, schema validation, 
    data transformation pipelines, and cross-file relationship management. Enable sophisticated 
    queries, updates, and analytics across entire CARL file ecosystem.
