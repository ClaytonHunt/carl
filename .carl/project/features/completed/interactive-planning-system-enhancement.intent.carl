intent_definition:
  what: "Fix the planning system to ask one question at a time and wait for answers before proceeding, preventing analysis in a vacuum and ensuring complete requirements gathering before analyst execution"
  why: "Current planning command negatively affects requirements analysis quality by sending incomplete information to the analyst without waiting for user answers, compromising the entire CARL system effectiveness"
  who: ["all_carl_users", "carl_system_developer", "ai_assistants_consuming_carl_context"]
  when: "Critical fix needed immediately - all planning depends on this system"
  constraints:
    - "must_ask_single_question_at_a_time_and_wait_for_response"
    - "must_inform_follow_up_questions_with_initial_input_and_previous_answers"
