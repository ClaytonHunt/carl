# Feature Implementation Roadmap:
# Week 1: Story creation, completion detection logic, basic atomic operations
# Week 2: Tracking integration, error handling, comprehensive testing
# Week 3: Feature flag deployment, validation, user acceptance testing

# Success Validation Criteria:
# - Zero manual completion workflow steps required
# - 100% git history preservation for moved files
# - Immediate status reflection of completion changes
# - No performance degradation in task execution
# - Seamless integration with existing task command functionality
