description: |
  Testing the progress tracking hook functionality.
  This work item will simulate progress updates based on activity patterns.

requirements:
  - Detect schema validation activity (should add 5% progress)
  - Detect git commits (should add 10% progress) 
  - Detect testing activity (should add 15% progress)
  - Reach milestone thresholds and log them

acceptance_criteria:
  - Progress increases based on activity patterns
  - Milestone notifications at 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 100%
  - Session metrics are properly aggregated

implementation_notes: |
  This is a test feature to verify progress tracking.
  We'll simulate different activity types to test the increment logic.
  
  Activity simulation:
  - Schema validation: +5% progress
  - Git commits: +10% progress
  - Testing activity: +15% progress
  - Documentation: +8% progress
