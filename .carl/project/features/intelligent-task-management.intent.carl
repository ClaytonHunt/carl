id: "intelligent_task_management"
type: "feature"
parent_id: "epics/requirements-driven-workflow"
complexity: "high"
priority: "P0"
estimated_duration: "1 week"
created_date: "2025-07-30T17:00:00-04:00"
status: "planning"

intent_definition:
  what: "Transform /carl:task into intelligent work management system with context-aware suggestions and seamless task continuation"
  why: "Current task execution lacks intelligence - users must manually decide what to work on next without system guidance or work queue awareness"
  who: ["carl_users", "ai_assistants", "development_teams"]
  when: "Implement immediately after interactive planning system completion"
  constraints:
    - "must_maintain_existing_carl_task_command_interface"
    - "must_work_with_active_work_tracking_system"
    - "must_provide_sub_30_second_task_continuation"
    - "must_integrate_with_enhanced_context_injection"

user_stories:
  - id: "smart_work_suggestions"
    description: "As a developer, I want /carl:task to suggest my next logical task based on current work and queue"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "When I run /carl:task without arguments, show intelligent suggestions"
      - "Suggestions include continue current work, next logical tasks, and quick wins"
      - "Each suggestion includes estimated time and reasoning"
      - "Suggestions are prioritized based on work patterns and dependencies"
    
  - id: "seamless_task_continuation"
    description: "As a developer, I want to quickly resume where I left off in my last session"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "/carl:task --continue loads my current substep automatically"
      - "Context includes exactly where I was and what's next"
      - "Continuation happens in under 30 seconds"
      - "All relevant files and progress are loaded"
    
  - id: "work_queue_intelligence"
    description: "As a developer, I want the system to manage my work queue intelligently"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "Ready tasks are presented when dependencies are met"
      - "Blocked tasks are identified with clear blockers"
      - "Queue is prioritized based on business value and effort"
      - "System suggests optimal task ordering"
    
  - id: "context_aware_execution"
    description: "As a developer, I want task execution to be aware of my work patterns and preferences"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "System learns my preferred task sizes and work style"
      - "Suggestions adapt to my context switching tolerance"
      - "Deep work sessions are respected and protected"
      - "Quick wins are suggested when appropriate"
