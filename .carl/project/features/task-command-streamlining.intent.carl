# Type: Feature
# Parent: Requirements-Driven Workflow Epic

id: "task_command_streamlining"
type: "feature"
parent_id: "epics/requirements-driven-workflow"
complexity: "medium"
priority: "P0"
estimated_duration: "4 hours"
created_date: "2025-07-30T18:50:00-04:00"
status: "planning"

intent_definition:
  what: "Streamline /carl:task command to match the simplified architecture of /carl:plan with external workflow files"
  why: "Task command is currently complex with 260+ lines while plan command is streamlined to ~50 lines, creating architectural inconsistency and maintenance overhead"
  who: ["carl_users", "ai_assistants", "development_teams"]
  when: "Complete immediately to finish Requirements-Driven Workflow epic at 100%"
  constraints:
    - "must_preserve_all_existing_functionality_from_current_task_command"
    - "must_achieve_81_percent_token_reduction_to_match_plan_command"
    - "must_follow_proven_master_process_lazy_loading_architecture"
    - "must_maintain_sub_100ms_context_loading_performance"

    description: "As a CARL system, I want task execution workflow moved to external file for architectural consistency"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "Create .carl/system/workflows/task.workflow.carl with full workflow logic"
      - "Task command references external workflow file like plan command"
      - "All 260+ lines of current functionality preserved in external file"
      - "Master process lazy loading integration implemented"
    
  - id: "create_simplified_command_modes"
    description: "As a user, I want task command to have clear modes like the plan command"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - "Intelligent Work Suggestions mode: no arguments or --suggest flag"
      - "Direct Task Execution mode: task description provided"
      - "Flag-based Operations mode: --continue, --next, --from-intent flags"
      - "Streamlined command file reduced to ~50 lines (81% reduction)"
    
  - id: "integrate_master_process_lazy_loading"
    description: "As a system architect, I want task command to use proven lazy loading pattern"
    acceptance_criteria:

      - "Workflow file loaded on-demand when needed"
      - "Context injection follows established token-efficient pattern"
      - "Performance target of sub-100ms maintained"
