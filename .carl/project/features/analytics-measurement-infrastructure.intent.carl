  name: "Analytics and Measurement Infrastructure"
  description: "Comprehensive data processing pipeline for velocity analytics, performance measurement, and project insights"
  
  problem_statement: |
    Current bash-based system cannot perform sophisticated analytics needed for velocity measurement,
    trend analysis, and predictive forecasting. Teams lack visibility into actual performance metrics,
    making data-driven planning impossible. Need robust analytics infrastructure to transform raw
    session and timing data into actionable insights.
  
  solution_approach: |
    Build Node.js analytics pipeline with data aggregation, statistical analysis, trend detection,
    and visualization capabilities. Enable real-time metrics calculation, historical analysis,
    and predictive modeling for improved project planning and performance optimization.
