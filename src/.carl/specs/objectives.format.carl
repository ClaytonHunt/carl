# Implementation Notes:
# - Objectives provide measurable success criteria for vision and roadmap
# - Should be updated regularly based on actual performance data
# - Enable data-driven decision making for feature prioritization
# - Support both leading and lagging indicators for comprehensive measurement
# - Link business success to technical delivery and user satisfaction
