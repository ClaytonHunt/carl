    debt_items = {}
    
    // Code quality analysis
    quality_issues = analyze_code_quality_metrics()
    FOR EACH issue IN quality_issues DO
        debt_item = {
            type: "code_quality",
            description: issue.description,
            location: issue.file_location,
            severity: assess_debt_severity(issue),
            business_impact: evaluate_business_impact(issue),
            effort_estimate: estimate_fix_effort(issue),
            technical_risk: assess_technical_risk(issue)
        }
        debt_items[issue.id] = debt_item
    END FOR
    
    // Architecture debt analysis
    architecture_issues = analyze_architectural_debt()
    FOR EACH issue IN architecture_issues DO
        debt_item = {
            type: "architectural",
            description: issue.pattern_violation,
            scope: issue.affected_components,
            refactoring_approach: suggest_refactoring_strategy(issue),
            business_value: assess_refactoring_value(issue)
        }

# Matrix Type: technical_debt_prioritization
# Metadata:
#   priority_levels: ["high", "medium", "low"]
#   criteria_types: ["business_impact", "fix_effort", "technical_risk"]
#   includes_impact_assessment: true
```

    debt_items = get_all_technical_debt()
    carl_integration = {}
    
    FOR EACH debt_item IN debt_items DO
        // Link debt to relevant CARL files
        related_features = find_related_features(debt_item)
        affected_contexts = find_affected_contexts(debt_item)
        
        integration_data = {
            debt_item: debt_item,
            carl_files_to_update: {
                state_files: related_features.state_files,
                context_files: affected_contexts.context_files

                resource_allocation: estimate_resource_needs(debt_item),
                risk_mitigation: create_risk_mitigation_plan(debt_item)
            }
        }
        
        carl_integration[debt_item.id] = integration_data
    END FOR
