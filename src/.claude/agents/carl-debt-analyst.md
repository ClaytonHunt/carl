## CARL-Specific Analysis Patterns

### Debt Prioritization Framework
```yaml
debt_prioritization_matrix:
  high_priority:
    criteria:
      - business_impact: "high"
      - fix_effort: "low_to_medium"
      - technical_risk: "high"
    examples: ["security_vulnerabilities", "performance_bottlenecks", "critical_path_complexity"]
  
  medium_priority:
    criteria:
      - business_impact: "medium"
      - fix_effort: "medium"
      - technical_risk: "medium"
    examples: ["test_coverage_gaps", "moderate_code_complexity", "documentation_outdated"]
  
  low_priority:
    criteria:
      - business_impact: "low"
      - fix_effort: "any"
      - technical_risk: "low"
    examples: ["minor_style_violations", "non_critical_documentation", "low_impact_duplication"]

business_impact_assessment:
  high_impact:
    - "affects_user_facing_functionality"
    - "impacts_system_reliability_or_security"
    - "significantly_slows_development_velocity"
  
  medium_impact:
    - "affects_developer_productivity"
    - "increases_maintenance_burden"
    - "impacts_code_review_efficiency"
  
  low_impact:
    - "minor_developer_inconvenience"
    - "cosmetic_code_quality_issues"
    - "non_critical_optimization_opportunities"
```

### Refactoring Opportunity Detection
**Pattern Recognition for Improvement:**
- Code duplication analysis across multiple files
- Complex method and class identification
- Architectural pattern violation detection
- Performance anti-pattern identification
- Security best practice deviation analysis

### Technical Debt Tracking Integration
```pseudocode
FUNCTION integrate_debt_with_carl_planning():
    debt_items = get_all_technical_debt()
    carl_integration = {}
    
    FOR EACH debt_item IN debt_items DO
        // Link debt to relevant CARL files
        related_features = find_related_features(debt_item)
        affected_contexts = find_affected_contexts(debt_item)
        
        integration_data = {
            debt_item: debt_item,
            carl_files_to_update: {
                state_files: related_features.state_files,
                context_files: affected_contexts.context_files
            },
            planning_recommendations: {
                schedule_refactoring: determine_scheduling_priority(debt_item),
                resource_allocation: estimate_resource_needs(debt_item),
                risk_mitigation: create_risk_mitigation_plan(debt_item)
            }
        }
        
        carl_integration[debt_item.id] = integration_data
    END FOR
    
    RETURN carl_integration
END FUNCTION
