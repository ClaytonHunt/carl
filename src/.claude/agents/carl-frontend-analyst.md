## CARL Analysis Workflow

### 1. UI Component Discovery
```pseudocode
FUNCTION analyze_ui_components_for_carl():
    components = discover_all_components()
    component_analysis = {}
    
    FOR EACH component IN components DO
        component_data = {
            name: component.name,
            type: classify_component_type(component),
            purpose: extract_component_purpose(component),
            user_interactions: analyze_user_interactions(component),
            data_requirements: extract_data_dependencies(component),
            state_management: analyze_state_patterns(component),
            accessibility: assess_accessibility_features(component)
        }
        component_analysis[component.id] = component_data
    END FOR
    
    RETURN component_analysis
END FUNCTION
```

## CARL-Specific Analysis Patterns

### User Journey Extraction
```pseudocode
FUNCTION extract_user_journeys():
    journeys = {}
    routes = discover_all_routes()
    
    FOR EACH route IN routes DO
        // Analyze route components and interactions
        components = get_route_components(route)
        interactions = analyze_component_interactions(components)
        
        journey = {
            entry_point: route.path,
            user_goal: infer_user_goal(route, components),
            steps: extract_interaction_steps(interactions),
            success_criteria: define_success_metrics(journey),
            failure_scenarios: identify_error_paths(interactions),
            accessibility_requirements: assess_accessibility_needs(components)
        }
        
        journeys[route.name] = journey
    END FOR
    
    RETURN journeys
END FUNCTION
```

### Component Relationship Analysis
**UI Component Dependencies:**
- Analyze parent-child component relationships
- Extract prop interfaces and data flow patterns
- Identify shared state dependencies and mutations
- Map component lifecycle and interaction patterns
- Document reusable component patterns and variations

### State Management Analysis
```pseudocode
FUNCTION analyze_frontend_state_management():
    state_analysis = {}
    
    // Global state analysis
    global_stores = discover_state_stores()
    FOR EACH store IN global_stores DO
        state_analysis[store.name] = {
            state_shape: extract_state_structure(store),
            mutations: analyze_state_mutations(store),
            component_usage: find_components_using_store(store),
            data_sources: identify_data_sources(store)
        }
    END FOR
    
    // Local state analysis
    components_with_state = find_stateful_components()
    FOR EACH component IN components_with_state DO
        local_state = {
            state_variables: extract_local_state(component),
            state_updates: analyze_state_updates(component),
            side_effects: identify_side_effects(component)
        }
        state_analysis[component.name + "_local"] = local_state
    END FOR
    
    RETURN state_analysis
END FUNCTION
```
