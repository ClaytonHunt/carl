## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) - Anthropic's official CLI
- Git 2.20+ 
- Bash 4.0+ (for hook system)
- **jq** - JSON processor ([install guide](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/))
- **yq** - YAML processor ([install guide](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases))
- Basic familiarity with YAML schemas

### First Time Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git fork https://github.com/carlsystem/carl
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/carl.git
   cd carl
   ```

2. **Install CARL in Development Mode**
   ```bash
   # Copy CARL system to your project (symlink for development)
   ln -s $(pwd)/.carl ~/.carl-dev
   ln -s $(pwd)/.claude ~/.claude-dev
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   claude # Start Claude Code
   /carl:status # Should show CARL system active
   ```

## Development Setup

### Understanding the Codebase

CARL has several key areas:

```
.carl/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/              # Bash scripts for automation
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/           # Shared hook utilities
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *.sh          # Hook implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schemas/           # YAML schema definitions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sessions/          # Session tracking (generated)

.claude/

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/carl/     # Command implementations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.json      # Hook configuration

docs/                  # Comprehensive documentation

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/       # Implementation guides
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/         # Command documentation
```

### Development Principles

1. **Use CARL to Build CARL** - All development should use CARL workflow
2. **Schema First** - All data structures must have schemas
3. **Hook Driven** - Automation via lightweight bash hooks
4. **Agent Specialization** - Create focused, single-purpose agents
5. **Documentation Driven** - All features documented before implementation

## Contributing Workflow

### 1. Choose Your Contribution

**Areas for Contribution:**
- üêõ **Bug Fixes** - Fix issues in existing functionality
- ‚ú® **Features** - Add new CARL capabilities  
- üìö **Documentation** - Improve guides and references
- üß™ **Testing** - Add test coverage and validation
- üé® **Agent Development** - Create specialized agents
- üîß **Hook Improvements** - Enhance automation scripts

### 2. Plan Your Work

Use CARL's own system to plan your contribution:

```bash
# Plan your contribution using CARL
/carl:plan "Fix schema validation error handling in completion hook"

# This creates a proper CARL file with scope, timeline, and acceptance criteria
```

### 3. Development Process

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-contribution

# Use CARL to execute your planned work
/carl:task your-contribution.story.carl

# CARL will guide you through implementation with:
# - TDD enforcement (if enabled)
# - Progress tracking
# - Quality gates
# - Completion validation
```

### 4. Quality Assurance

Before submitting, ensure:

- [ ] All hook scripts are executable and properly formatted
- [ ] Schema files are valid YAML and complete
- [ ] Documentation is updated for any new features
- [ ] Agent files follow naming conventions and include proper metadata
- [ ] Manual testing completed using CARL commands

## Code Standards

### Bash Scripts (Hooks)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# script-name.sh - Brief description
# Triggered by: [hook type]
# Dependencies: library-name.sh

# Always check for CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
if [[ -z "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-}" ]]; then
    echo "Error: CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR environment variable not set" >&2
    exit 1
fi

# Source required libraries
source "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.carl/hooks/lib/carl-session.sh"

# Use proper error handling
set -euo pipefail

# Document functions
# Description of what this function does
function_name() {
    local param1="$1"
    # Implementation
}
```

### YAML Schemas

```yaml
$schema: "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"
title: "Descriptive Schema Title"
description: "Clear description of what this schema validates"
type: object
additionalProperties: false

required:
  - essential_field
  - another_required_field

properties:
  field_name:
    type: string
    pattern: "^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*[a-z0-9]$"
    description: "Clear description of field purpose and format"
```
